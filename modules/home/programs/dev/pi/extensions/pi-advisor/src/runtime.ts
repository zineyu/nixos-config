/**
 * AdvisorRuntime — owns the per-turn review loop and delivery.
 *
 * Ported from oh-my-pi's `AdvisorRuntime`
 * (`packages/coding-agent/src/advisor/runtime.ts`), adapted to the pi extension
 * surface: instead of driving a second pi `Agent`, it runs `runAdvisorReview`
 * (a `completeSimple` loop) per queued turn and delivers the captured advice
 * back into the primary session via `pi.sendMessage`.
 *
 * Preserved from oh-my-pi:
 * - A backlog queue + single-flight `busy` guard so reviews never overlap.
 * - An `epoch` counter bumped on reset/dispose/session_start/compact/tree-nav
 *   so an in-flight review whose session was replaced/rewritten mid-prompt is
 *   dropped instead of delivering stale advice into the new conversation.
 * - 3-strike failure drop so a broken advisor model never stalls the session.
 * - Non-interrupting `nit` vs interrupting `concern`/`blocker` delivery.
 *
 * Two-layer repeat guard (B5): the advisor can't see its own prior advice
 * (those custom messages are not part of the per-turn payload), so a hard
 * delivery-time dedupe prevents repeats, and a compact "recent advice" preamble
 * is injected into the session-update header to give the model awareness (only
 * when dedupe didn't fire, so it never re-anchors on its own filtered output).
 *
 * Simplified for the extension:
 * - Reviews are fire-and-forget from `turn_end` (never block the main agent).
 * - The per-turn delta is the `turn_end` event's `message` + `toolResults`
 *   (see transcript.ts), not a byte-delta or a branch window. A rolling char
 *   buffer keeps cross-turn context bounded by `contextChars`.
 * - A lifecycle `AbortSignal` (captured per-turn) is threaded to the review and
 *   to the retry backoff, so abort/shutdown cancels in-flight work.
