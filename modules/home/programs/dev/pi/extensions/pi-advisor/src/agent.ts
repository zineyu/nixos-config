/**
 * The advisor agent loop.
 *
 * oh-my-pi implements the advisor as a full `Agent` (from its pi-agent-core
 * fork) with its own append-only context, telemetry, and tool-execution loop.
 * The public pi extension API doesn't expose that `Agent` class, so this module
 * re-implements the essential advisor loop with pi-ai's `completeSimple()`: it
 * prompts the advisor model with the session update + a hard-isolated read-only
 * toolset, executes read/grep/find locally, captures the `advise` call, and
 * loops until the advisor calls `advise`, stays silent, or hits the round cap.
 *
 * `completeSimple` (not `complete`) is used because the `reasoning`/thinking
 * option is only honoured on the `streamSimple` path — the plain `stream` path
 * ignores it. Tools ride in `context.tools` and are forwarded by every
 * provider's `streamSimple` implementation, so tool-calling + thinking both
 * work.
 *
 * The loop never mutates the primary session: its only side-effect is the
 * captured `advise` note, which the runtime delivers via `pi.sendMessage`.
